Some javascript code was derived from Chris Veness's work found at
https://github.com/chrisveness/geodesy. Thanks Chris! It would have
taken much longer to do this without your blood, sweat, and tears.

The standard deviation function was authored by Derick Bailey. I
want to give credit where credit is due. The code was found here:
